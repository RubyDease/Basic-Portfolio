							    			<p>This is my story…

			Borne and raised in Canada, I’ve spent my time in high school deciding what am I going to do for a carrier.
			I’ve started very early with my adult life after I’ve graduated for high school, like I didn’t have time time to loose.  I went through motherhood, workforce and continuing my education at night for many years. 
			Funny to say I’ve started at the time a computer science degree, remember coding Dbase with a commodore 18K – but since my brain was too young at the time to understand coding, I jumped into other type of sciences “chemistry”- specialized in Oil/petroleum.</p>

			<p>I guess my comfort zone is “change”- there is always someone out there telling me “are you crazy!” ...when I comment about my next step – what I’m going to do.
			Between working and studding, taking care of a kid/house and others at the same time, I finally made it and graduate.</p>

			<p>I made a carrier as a chemist for about 10 years in different industries until I decided that I needed to try something else. I always feel that I need something new to learn.
			My next endeavor, project management- I was told once again “are you crazy …why going back to school you already have a job!!!”.... It got worse…I went for a certificate while I was refining my skills, getting more experience in the field and pursued my PMP certification.</p>

			<p>I’ve being working in that field for the last 12 years in different industries including optical components, entertainment /digital media and technology.

			Today, I guess my next endeavor before my golden age is web development, I’m sure this new skill will get me to where I wanted to do in life in combination with my other skills.  And guess what ...the “are you crazy” came out again…. It doesn’t matter if I leave in Montreal, California, North Carolina all the same. I figured is not the people, its me …. I’m really a crazy person.</p>

			<p>What I’ve learned from the efforts that I’ve made thought out this year is that by making the effort and getting out of my comfort zone all the jobs that I got through out my carrier were because of what I’ve learned and not because I knew someone in the industry /company. 

			That’s what crazy people do... </p>
